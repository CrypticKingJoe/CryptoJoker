	DECRYPTION PHASE

--Step one(Preparation)--
1. Check if the public key inserted has a valid length. If it has then proceed. There should be
try-catches inside the RSA algorithms for errors. If error occure the user should be notified that
the key is invalid.

2. After checking if the key is valid then proceed in the password decryption process.
Get the password from the appdata folder and decrypt it.

2. Get all files in the current user folder.

--Step Two(Decryption)
3. Decrypt all files based on their extensions. If partially is contained, then decrypt
the file partially. Else decrypt it fully.

4. Remove the extensions from the file.

--Step Three(Cleanup)
5. Remove the password contained in the appdata folder.
6. Remove the GUI and the text file that notifies the user about the ransomware from the desktop.
