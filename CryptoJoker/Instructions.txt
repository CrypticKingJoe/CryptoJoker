	ENCRYPTION PHASE

--Step One(Preparation)--
1.Get all files in the current user folder.

--Step Two(Encryption)--
2.Encrypt the file depending on it's size. If it is a text document with maximum 2GB
then encrypt it fully. Else encrypt only partially.

3. Change the file extension. Add the proper keyword if it is partially or fully encrypted and
then the ransomware extension(.cryptojoker).

For example: filename.exe.partially.cryptojoker
                
--Step Three(Information storage and user notify)--
4. After the step two has been completed(encryption step), then get the encryption key
and save it in the appdata folder, encrypted with the RSA algorithm using the public key.

5. Add the GUI + a text file in the desktop that will notify the user for being blackmailed.
The GUI should be added to the computer startup.
