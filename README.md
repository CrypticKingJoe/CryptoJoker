# CryptoJoker

## Description

CryptoJoker is a managed ransomware created for EDUCATION PURPOSES ONLY written exclusively in C#. Even though CryptoJoker has been succesfully tested
on a Windows 10 Virtual Machine, is not meant to work in real world. CryptoJoker has been coded with safety and fastness in mind without "burden" one another.
CryptoJoker uses a combination of a "custom XOR" encryption and RSA. A private public/private pair key is generated for every computer ... and the private
key is delivered back to the "owner" through an e-mail account. The delivery method can very easily change to FTP or whatever you want.
